# Cloud Computing

 ## What Is The Cloud?

Cloud computing is a subscription-based service where you can obtain networked storage space and
computer resources. Cloud computing, in its most basic definition, is the supply of computer services via the Internet (or "the cloud"), including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. This enables speedier innovation, adaptable resource allocation, and cost savings.

### Real-World Example of Cloud Computing
`One way to think of cloud computing is to consider your experience with
email. Your email client, if it is Yahoo!, Gmail, Hotmail, and so on, takes care of housing all of
the hardware and software necessary to support your personal email account. When you want to
access your email you open your web browser, go to the email client, and log in. The most
important part of the equation is having internet access. Your email is not housed on your
physical computer; you access it through an internet connection, and you can access it anywhere.
If you are on a trip, at work, or down the street getting coffee, you can check your email as long
as you have access to the internet. Your email is different than software installed on your
computer, such as a word processing program. When you create a document using word
processing software, that document stays on the device you used to make it unless you physically
move it. An email client is similar to how cloud computing works. Except instead of accessing
just your email, you can choose what information you have access to within the cloud.`

## Types Of Clouds
Depending on your demands, there are various clouds to which you can subscribe. Most likely, as a consumer or owner of a small business, you will use public cloud services. 

- **1. Public Cloud** - A public cloud can be accessed by any subscriber with an internet connection
and access to the cloud space.
- **2. Private Cloud** -A private cloud is established for a specific group or organization and limits
access to just that group.
- **3. Community Cloud** - A community cloud is shared among two or more organizations that
have similar cloud requirements.
- **4. Hybrid Cloud** - A hybrid cloud is essentially a combination of at least two clouds, where the
clouds included are a mixture of public, private, or community.
